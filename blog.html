      <h3>“All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” – Taylor Swift</h3>
      <p>
        The rawest, most heartbreakingly detailed piece Taylor has ever written. 
        The lyrics are poetry — full of imagery, memory, and emotion. 
        I still get chills at “You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath.”

      <h3>“Happier Than Ever” – Billie Eilish</h3>
      <p>
        This song is a masterpiece of two halves. It starts as a soft, melancholic ukulele ballad before exploding into a powerful, cathartic rock anthem. It's an incredible journey of emotion, from quiet sadness to righteous anger. The production is just phenomenal.

      <h3>Lizzy McAlpine – "ceilings"</h3>
      <p>
        This song doesn't play — it floats. It's what a memory would sound like if it had soft footsteps and a breaking heart. A love that might’ve only existed in your own head… and that’s the most haunting part.

      <h3>Seventeen – "April Shower"</h3>
      <p>
        A rainy spring day in song form — gentle, hopeful, and refreshingly honest. It’s about holding hands with your past self and telling them, "we made it."

      <h3>&TEAM – "Blind Love"</h3>
      <p>
        A song that feels like wandering through your own feelings without a map — uncertain, beautiful, a little dangerous. It’s about falling for someone so deeply, you stop caring where the edge is. Because love, even blind, still feels like light.

      <h3>Treasure – "HELLO"</h3>
      <p>
        Like yelling out the window during a joyride with your best friends — loud, colorful, and full of heart. It’s a reminder that even chaos can feel like home.
